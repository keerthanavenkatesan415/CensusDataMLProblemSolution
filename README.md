# 🚀 Define and Solve a Machine Learning Problem

This project is from **Lab 8** in my Machine Learning coursework as part of Break Through Tech AI program.  
I implemented the **entire ML lifecycle**: dataset selection, problem definition, EDA, project planning, model training, evaluation, and performance improvement.

## 📌 Project Overview
In this notebook, I:
1. Built a **DataFrame** from a real-world dataset.
2. **Defined a predictive ML problem** (classification).
3. Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and trends.
4. Designed a **project plan** for ML pipeline.
5. Implemented the plan:
   - Preprocessed and cleaned data.
   - Applied **feature scaling** and **encoding**.
   - Trained ML models (**Logistic Regression** & **Random Forest**).
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision-recall, confusion matrix, and AUC.
   - Tuned hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**.

## 📂 Dataset
For this project, I worked with the **Census dataset (1994)** to define and solve a classification problem of predicting if income would be greater or less than, or equal to 50k.
